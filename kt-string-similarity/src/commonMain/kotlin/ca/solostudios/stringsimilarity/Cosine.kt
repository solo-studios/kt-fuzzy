/**
 * Implements Cosine Similarity between strings. The strings are first
 * transformed in vectors of occurrences of k-shingles (sequences of k
 * characters). In this n-dimensional space, the similarity between the two
 * strings is the cosine of their respective vectors.
 *
 * The similarity between the two strings is the cosine of the angle between
 * these two vectors representation. It is computed as V1 . V2 / (|V1| * |V2|)
 * The cosine distance is computed as 1 - cosine similarity.
