/**
 * The Levenshtein distance, or edit distance, between two words is the
 * minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or
 * substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
 *
 * [Levenshtein distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
 *
 * - It is always at least the difference of the sizes of the two strings.
 * - It is at most the length of the longer string.
 * - It is zero if and only if the strings are equal.
 * - If the strings are the same size, the Hamming distance is an upper bound
 *   on the Levenshtein distance.
 * - The Levenshtein distance obeys the triangle inequality (the distance
 *   between two strings is no greater than the sum Levenshtein distances from
 *   a third string), so it is a [metric distance][MetricStringDistance].
 *
 * The similarity is computed as
 * \(\frac{w_d \lvert X \rvert + w_i \lvert Y \rvert - distance(X, Y)}{2}\).
 *
 * Implementation uses dynamic programming (Wagnerâ€“Fischer algorithm), with
 * only 2 rows of data. The space requirement is thus \(O(m)\) and the algorithm
 * runs in \(O(m \times n)\).
 *
 * @param limit The maximum result to compute before stopping.
 * @param insertionWeight The weight of an insertion. Represented as \(w_i\). Must be in the range \(&#91;0, 1 \times 10^{10} &#93;\).
 * @param deletionWeight The weight of a deletion. Represented as \(w_d\). Must be in the range \(&#91;0, 1 \times 10^{10} &#93;\).
 * @param substitutionWeight The weight of a substitution. Represented as \(w_s\). Must be in the range \(&#91;0, 1 \times 10^{10} &#93;\).
