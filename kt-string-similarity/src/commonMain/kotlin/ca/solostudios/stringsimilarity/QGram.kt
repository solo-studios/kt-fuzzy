 * The distance between two strings is defined as
 * the number of occurrences of different q-grams in each string:
 * \(\sum_{i=1}^n \lVert \vec{v1_i} - \vec{v2_i} \rVert\).
 * Q-gram distance is a lower bound on Levenshtein distance, but can be computed in \(O(m + n)\),
 * whereas the Levenshtein distance has a time complexity of \(O(m \times n)\).
 *
 * This distance measure is pseudo-metric.
 * It is not a metric because two non-identical strings can have identical q-gram profiles,
 * resulting in \(distance(X, Y) = 0\) where \(X \neq Y\).
 * However, it does respect the other 3 axioms.
 *
 * @param q The length of each q-gram.
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if \(k \leqslant 0\)
