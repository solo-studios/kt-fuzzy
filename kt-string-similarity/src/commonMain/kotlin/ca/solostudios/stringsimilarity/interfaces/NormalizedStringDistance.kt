/**
 * Normalized string distances return a normalized distance between two strings.
 *
 * The returned distance is always in the range \(&#91;0, 1]\).
 * - `0` indicates that both strings are *equivalent*. Equivalent strings are not necessarily identical.
 * - `1` indicates that neither string have anything in common.
 * - If two strings are identical, then it should always return `0`.
 *
 * The normalized similarity of any normalized string measure can always be computed as is computed as
 * \(1 - distance(X, Y)\).
 *
 * As stated in "Computation of Normalized Edit Distance and Applications",
 * > Given two strings \(x\) and \(y\) over a finite alphabet,
 * > the normalized edit distance between \(x\) and \(y\), \(d(x,y)\)
 * > is defined as the minimum of \(W(p)/L(p)\),
 * > here \(p\) is an editing path between \(x\) and \(y\), \(W(p)\)
 * > is the sum of the weights of the elementary edit operations of \(p\),
 * > and \(L(p)\) is the number of these operations (length of \(p\)).
