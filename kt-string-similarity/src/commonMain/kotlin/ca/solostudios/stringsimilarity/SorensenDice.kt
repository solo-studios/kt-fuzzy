 * Sorensen-Dice coefficient, aka SÃ¸rensen index, Dice's coefficient or
 * Czekanowski's binary (non-quantitative) index.
 *
 * The strings are first converted to boolean sets of k-shingles (sequences
 * of k characters), then the similarity is computed as 2 * |A inter B| /
 * (|A| + |B|). Attention: Sorensen-Dice distance (and similarity) does not
 * satisfy triangle inequality.
 *
 * Similar to Jaccard index, but this time the similarity is computed as 2 * |V1
 * inter V2| / (|V1| + |V2|). Distance is computed as 1 - cosine similarity.
